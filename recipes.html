                <h1>Apple Pie  </h1>
<p>Ingredients 
<br>1 box (14.1 oz.) refrigerated pie crusts
<br>    For the Filling:
<br> 6 cups peeled, thinly sliced
<br>¾ cup sugar
<br>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
<br>1 tablespoon lemon juice
<br>¾ teaspoon cinnamon
<br>¼ teaspoon nutmeg
<br>¼ teaspoon salt
<br> 
<br>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Bring refrigerated pie crusts to room temperature.
Unroll 1 pie crust and press it into a 9-inch glass pie plate.
In a large bowl, toss together all of the filling ingredients.
Transfer filling to the pie plate. Unroll the second pie crust and place it on top of the apples.
Tuck the extra top crust under the bottom crust edge, pinching together with your fingers to seal.
Cut slits in the top of the pie (to allow steam to vent).
Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. About halfway through the baking time, cover the edge of the crust with strips of aluminum foil to prevent the edges from becoming too dark.
Cool pie on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing and serving.

                <h1>Garlic Butter Fish  </h1>
                <p>
                    INGREDIENTS
 <br>12 oz. firm white fish fillet (halibut, cod or pollock fillet)
 <br>salt
 <br>ground black pepper
 <br>3 dashes cayenne pepper
 <br>2 tablespoons corn starch
 <br>2 tablespoons cooking oil
 <br>lemon wedges
<br>-->Garlic Butter Sauce
 <br>1/2 stick salted butter, melted (4 tablespoons)
 <br>3 cloves garlic, minced
 <br>1/2 tablespoon lemon juice
 <br>1 tablespoon chopped parsley
<br> Cut the fish into pieces, not to thin for easy pan-frying. Season the fish with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Coat the fish with corn starch. Set aside. Prepare the Garlic Butter Sauce by mixing all the ingredients together. Set aside. Heat up a skillet (preferably non-stick) on medium heat. Add the cooking oil and once the oil is heated, pan-fry the fish in a single layer until both sides turn crispy and golden brown. Use a wooden spatula or tong to gently flip the fish over. Try not to break the fish. Remove the fish from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Toss the fish with the Garlic Butter Sauce and serve immediately with lemon wedges.

                <h1>Chickpea Curry with Rice </h1>
                <p> Ingredients
                 
<br> 2 cups basmati rice
<br>2 tablespoons vegetable oil
<br>1 large onion, chopped
<br>Salt and ground black pepper
<br>2 teaspoons curry powder
<br>2 cloves garlic, chopped
<br>1 cup vegetable stock
<br>Two 15-ounce cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
<br>One 13.5-ounce can coconut milk
<br>Chopped fresh coriander, for garnish
<br>
<br> Cook the basmati rice according to the package instructions.
Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper and cook until the onions are dark brown and caramelized, about 10 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in the vegetable stock and stir to scrape up all the brown bits in the pan. Add the chickpeas, coconut milk, honey and a squirt of sriracha. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
