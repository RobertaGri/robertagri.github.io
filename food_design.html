          <h1>What is food photography? </h1>
          <p>It is a still life photography genre used to create attractive still life photographs of food.

          <h1> It is special... </h1>
          <p> We can hear that a beautifully executed food image will make the viewer's mouth water and their stomach rumble! Moreover, great food photographers are rising to the task of bringing to life the most famous metaphor of the literary circles of the beginning of the twentieth century: the Madeleine of Marcel Proust (the French novelist used a sponge cake to illustrate the strength of sensory triggers). Van Tonder is no exception; for him, it is not just about a pretty picture, it is about creating an image that will ignite a feeling in the viewer. </p>
